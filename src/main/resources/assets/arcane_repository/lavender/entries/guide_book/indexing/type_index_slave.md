Index extension books offer a way to both extend the range of your 
[indexing](^arcane_repository:indexing/type_indexing) book, and create more points of access for your repository.

;;;;;

For one, these books can be linked to a single indexing book placed on a lectern.
They will then act as a proxy to this master book, allowing you to access its contents as if you were using it directly.


Additionally, extension books also have their own indexing range.
When placed on a lectern, bookshelves in this range will be accessible to the master book,
and in turn, accessible from this and any other linked extension books.

;;;;;

Linking many extension books to one master effectively allows you to extend 
the scale of your repository indefinitely, given enough resources.

;;;;;

It should be noted that using an index extension book directly from your inventory retains its functionality to access the master book,
but will not allow you or the master book to access any bookshelves in its own range,
making them an effective tool remote access to your repository.
