Instead of [interacting with an area](^arcane_repository:indexing/mode_area), 
indexing books can also be linked directly to specific bookshelves. 
The amount of bookshelves that can be linked to one book is quite limited, 
but using this method *significantly* increases their interaction range. (e.g. hundreds of blocks instead of tens)

;;;;;

Linking or unlinking an index book from a bookshelf can be done by 
shift-right-clicking the bookshelf with it.
Any linked bookshelves will light up when the book is held in your hand.


Every linked bookshelf will use up one link slot as shown in the book's tooltip.
This limit can be increased using [Link Pages](^arcane_repository:indexing/attribute_links).


The extended interaction range can also be affected by [Range Pages](^arcane_repository:indexing/attribute_range).
