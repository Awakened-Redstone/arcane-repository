While [Tattered Pages](^arcane_repository:general/tattered_pages) can be restored relatively easily, 
this might not be a viable strategy in the long term, due to their relative scarcity. 
Ender Pearl Shards can be used as an alternative to craft blank pages from ordinary paper.

Getting Ender Pearl Shards requires destroying an Ender Pearl without using it to teleport. 
This can be done in many ways, such as fire, explosions, etc. 
but by far the easiest is to drop one into a cactus *in item form*.
Make sure you're close enough to pick up the shards though!

After doing this, you can combine the shards with Paper and Glowstone Dust to craft blank pages:
