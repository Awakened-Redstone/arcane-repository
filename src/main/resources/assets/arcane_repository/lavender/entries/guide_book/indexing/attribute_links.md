Links Attribute Pages can be added to [indexing](^arcane_repository:indexing/type_indexing) books to increase the amount
of linked bookshelves they can support. Check out the page on
[Linked Indexing](^arcane_repository:indexing/mode_linked) for a more detailed explanation.

;;;;;

Every links page added to a book will double the amount of linkable bookshelves exponentially.


Links pages are *not* supported on [index extension](^arcane_repository:indexing/type_index_slave) books,
as linking to more than one master book would not make sense.
