The amount of different types of items [item storage](^arcane_repository:item_storage/type_item_storage) 
books can hold is usually rather limited.
This page is used to increase that limit.


Every types page added to a book will *double* the type limit, similarly to
[stacks pages](^arcane_repository:item_storage/attribute_stacks).

Items that can stack in a regular inventory are considered the same type.
Though unlike normal inventories, 
unstackable items with matching NBT are also considered the same, and will only take up one type.
