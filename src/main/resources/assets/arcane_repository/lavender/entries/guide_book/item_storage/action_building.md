The building action page can be used to place blocks in the world directly from a book.
It can only be used in combination with a [Block Storage Page](^arcane_repository:item_storage/type_block_storage).

;;;;;

When right-clicked on another block, the block in the center slot of the book will be placed there,
as if you were holding it normally.


*The top-center slot in the recipe can be any block*
