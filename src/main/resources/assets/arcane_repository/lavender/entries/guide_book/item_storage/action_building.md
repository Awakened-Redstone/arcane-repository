```json
{
  "title": "Action: Building",
  "icon": "arcane_repository:building_action_page",
  "category": "arcane_repository:item_storage"
}
```

The building action page can be used to place blocks in the world directly from a book.
It can only be used in combination with a [Block Storage Page](^arcane_repository:item_storage/type_block_storage).
