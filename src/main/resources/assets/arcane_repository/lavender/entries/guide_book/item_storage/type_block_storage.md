The Block Storage Type Page is a subtype of the [Item Storage Type Page](^arcane_repository:item_storage/type_item_storage)
which only allows blocks and placeable items to be stored.


This is mostly useful for use with the [Building Action Page](^arcane_repository:item_storage/action_building),
though it is also slightly cheaper to make.

It can of course still be used as a storage medium for an indexed repository,
though in a lot of cases, adding filters to an item storage book is more practical.
