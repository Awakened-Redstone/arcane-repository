Repositories are mysterious and powerful collections that compress physical matter into pure information, 
and manipulate it in various ways.


This power can be applied in many ways, including convenience, 
portable storage of both dead and living matter, mining, building and large scale organisation 
and centralization of items.

Regretfully, the art of writing and compiling the books that make up repositories is one largely lost to time.


Thus, this book is my attempt to document and explain what little we do know of this lost art, 
in the hopes it may be of use to someone.


Sincerely,

Victor Tervosh
