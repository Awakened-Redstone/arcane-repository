    "Some type pages also have variant types, which may be required as a base for action or attribute pages. For example, the Item Storage Type Page has a variant called $(l:arcane_repository:item_storage/type_block_storage)Block Storage$(), which only stores items that can be placed as blocks. This restriction however means it can be used in conjunction with a $(l:arcane_repository:item_storage/action_building)Building Action Page$() to place blocks directly from a book.",
